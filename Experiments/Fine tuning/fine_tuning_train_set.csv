123,And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool.,"We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst, but, in fact, 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners.","It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems, and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it's cheaper than having a legal system, cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time.",1
124,"What does that mean, to invent dialogue?","Well, we know that the Festival of Dionysus gathered the entire citizenry of Athens on the side of the Acropolis, and they would listen to music, they would watch dancing, and they would have stories told as part of the Festival of Dionysus.",And storytelling is much like what's happening right now:,0
125,"This is a duo sailing around the world, getting paid every month for documenting their travels from 1,400 patrons.","This is a podcast, ""Chapo Trap House"", making -- actually, since I screenshotted this, they're making an additional 2,000 dollars per month, so they're now making 56,000 dollars per month for their podcast.",And Patreon's not the only one working on the problem.,0
126,And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well.,"When I'm walking around an art gallery, rooms and rooms full of paintings, after about 15 or 20 minutes, I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.",I'm not connecting to them.,1
127,Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?,"You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.","Now, here's the story.",1
128,"And so I invite you, us, we, to turn toward our fear; to embrace the things that scare us and find the love at the center.",We'll not only find ourselves there but we'll also be able to step into the shoes of those we fear and those who fear us.,"If we breathe into that fear and are vulnerable with the systems and people who challenge us, our power as changemakers grows exponentially.",1
129,And there's two things I do:,"When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast, and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other.","I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.",1
130,"My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students.","When the guys are struggling with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, ""Professor, there's something wrong with my code.""","The girls will come in and say, ""Professor, there's something wrong with me.""",1

132,The Star Trek Enterprise had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds to orbit other planets so that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere to see if the planet was habitable or if there were lifeforms there.,"Well, we don't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres, although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that.","We actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here, from Earth orbit.",1

135,"In short, I was prescribed a drug that needed long-term management and then I wasn't given that management, and it wasn't even clear whose job such management was.","This is a recipe for disaster and any such disaster would be interesting and worth talking about -- probably worth a TED Talk -- but the failure of opioid tapering is a particular concern at this moment in America because we are in the midst of an epidemic in which 33,000 people died from overdose in 2015.",Nearly half of those deaths involved prescription opioids.,1
136,Now what's the problem with this?,"Women are great, yep, absolutely.","But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders, but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week they're spending in a classroom, and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist.",1
137,Our night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets.,"We know, statistically speaking, that every star has at least one planet.","And in the search for planets, and in the future, planets that might be like Earth, we're able to help address some of the most amazing and mysterious questions that have faced humankind for centuries.",0
138,"If you went and looked for images of the Internet, this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.",We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.,"It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth, the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest, I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.",1
139,"You're disappointed immediately, because whether you knew it or not, you were coming to that theater to be part of an audience.","You were coming to have the collective experience of laughing together, crying together, holding your breath together to see what's going to happen next.","You may have walked into that theater as an individual consumer, but if the theater does its job, you've walked out with a sense of yourself as part of a whole, as part of a community.",1
140,"The prescribers saw me as a complex patient needing specialized care, probably from pain medicine.","The pain docs saw their job as getting pain under control and when I couldn't get off the medication, they saw me as the purview of addiction medicine.",But addiction medicine is overstressed and focused on those suffering from long-term substance use disorder.,1
141,Snowzilla?,Whatever you want to call it.,All two inches of it.,0

143,"You can see it has to be really, really wide in order to have a high enough surface area to process all of the air required, because remember, we're trying to capture just 400 molecules out of a million.","Using the liquid-based approach to do this, you take this high surface area packing material, you fill the contactor with the packing material, you use pumps to distribute liquid across the packing material, and you can use fans, as you can see in the front, to bubble the air through the liquid.",The CO2 in the air is separated [by] the liquid by reacting with the really strong-binding CO2 molecules in solution.,0
144,Take something like DonorsChoose.,"You go online, you can choose the individual teacher by name whose classroom you're going to be able to help by literally buying the specific items they've requested, like microscopes or laptops or flexible seating.","An appeal like that makes it so easy for me to imagine the good that my money will do, that I actually get an immediate sense of effectiveness the minute I commit to giving.",1
145,Theater matters because democracy matters.,"Theater is the essential art form of democracy, and we know this because they were born in the same city.","In the late 6th century BC, the idea of Western democracy was born.",1
146,"There was a second, more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature.",This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next.,The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Leo Kanner.,1
147,It had to be specific and believable.,This was the place where I was isolated and in total control.,"Since then, I've made a career of painting people in water.",1
148,Here's why.,This is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time.,"For most of the 20th century, autism was considered an incredibly rare condition.",0
149,"And so, we just mostly stand around waiting for someone to notice our needs and then spontaneously offer to help us with it.","This is a really, really bad assumption.","In fact, not only is it very difficult to tell what your needs are, but even the people close to you often struggle to understand how they can support you.",1
150,"Second, an activity question:","What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV?",And finally a mind-wandering question:,0

155,"People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years, but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.","Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.","In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion in research on happiness.",1
156,The stuff of the other world can't.,"We shouldn't assume that the world of is, of lengths and weights, has the same structure as the world of ought, of what we should do.","So if what matters to us -- a child's delight, the love you have for your partner — can't be represented by real numbers, then there's no reason to believe that in choice, there are only three possibilities -- that one alternative is better, worse or equal to the other.",1
157,"But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society, we had to go through two depressions, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Long Depression of the 1870s, two world wars, communist revolutions in Russia and in China, and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West.","We also, not coincidentally, went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions.",We created the modern welfare state.,1
158,The Amazon is capable of capturing 1.6 billion tons of CO2 each year.,This is the equivalent of roughly 25 percent of our annual emissions in the US.,The land area required for a synthetic forest or a manufactured direct air capture plant to capture the same is 500 times smaller.,0
159,"Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means, because in the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.",We went from 14 percent to seven percent.,That means that 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women.,0

163,"""All right. OK.""","You tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness, ""Should we send this child to the psychologist?""","And the answer is no, he's just a boy.",1
164,100 percent.,"This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence.","But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious.",1
165,"The combination of ""Rain Man,"" the changes to the criteria, and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism awareness.","The number of diagnoses started to soar, just as Lorna and Judith predicted, indeed hoped, that it would, enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved.","Then Andrew Wakefield came along to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines, a simple, powerful, and seductively believable story that was as wrong as Kanner's theory that autism was rare.",1
166,It's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared.,"We're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all, not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs.","A comparison of the overall merits of two jobs is something we can make, and one we often do make.",1

169,"For the American economy, for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half our population.","We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now.",We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old.,1
170,Questions mix with fear and erupt like bile in my throat.,Why are you looking in her eyes?,What do you know about this?,0
171,"But as a species, we are leaving that cocktail party behind.","We're leaving that culture, we're out of there.","We're going to get so good at paying creators, within 10 years, kids graduating high school and college are going to think of being a creator as just being an option -- I could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer, I could be a podcaster, I could have a web comic.",1

174,So what did we find?,"This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis, and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present, when they're not mind-wandering.","As it turns out, people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not.",0
175,"You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country, because staying is better in some ways, moving is better in others, and neither is better than the other overall.",We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big.,Let's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast.,1
176,"In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.","Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness.","Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.",1
177,"We could have all of the clever thinking and technology in the world, but it's not going to be enough in order for this technology to have a significant impact on climate.","We really need regulation, we need subsidies, taxes on carbon.","There are a few of us that would absolutely be willing to pay more, but what will be required is for carbon-neutral, carbon-negative paths to be affordable for the majority of society in order to impact climate.",1
178,"By autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distractable, obsessively social, and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.","To be sure, autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them. ","[Seventy] years later, we're still catching up to Asperger, who believed that the ""cure"" for the most disabling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers, accommodating employers, supportive communities, and parents who have faith in their children's potential.",1
179,You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in 1992.,"Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled to 1.7 trillion, and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class, whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.","So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy, but we've been slow to notice it.",1

198,"So the next thing was I wanted to put figures in these paintings, people, and I loved this new environment, so I wanted to have both people and this atmosphere.","When the idea hit me of how to do this, I got kind of nauseous and dizzy, which is really just adrenaline, probably, but for me it's a really good sign.",And so now I want to show you what I've been working on.,1
