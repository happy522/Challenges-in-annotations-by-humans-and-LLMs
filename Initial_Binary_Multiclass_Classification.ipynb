        "   - The TARGET text expresses emotional states or reactions.\n",
        "   - This can include:\n",
        "     - emotional reactions to events or things (e.g., “I’m happy about it”, “That scares me”),\n",
        "     - more enduring emotional dispositions (e.g., “I’m a nervous person”).\n",
        "   - Typical linguistic cues:\n",
        "     - emotion words (happy, sad, afraid, angry, delighted, bored, grateful, etc.),\n",
        "     - phrases like “makes me feel…”, “I love / hate…”.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Judgment (evaluation of people and behaviour)\n",
        "   - The TARGET text evaluates people or their behaviour/character in relation to social norms\n",
        "     (e.g., right/wrong, fair/unfair, honest/dishonest, capable/incompetent).\n",
        "   - Often about:\n",
        "     - social esteem (e.g., brave, careful, talented, lazy, rude),\n",
        "     - social sanction (e.g., honest, trustworthy, corrupt, unfair, immoral).\n",
        "   - Typical linguistic cues:\n",
        "     - adjectives for character or behaviour (“kind”, “irresponsible”, “unfair”),\n",
        "     - attributions of praise or blame (“she did the right thing”, “he failed his duty”).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Appreciation (evaluation of things, products, events, processes, phenomena)\n",
        "   - The TARGET text evaluates objects, artefacts, performances, texts, policies, situations,\n",
        "     or environments in terms of quality, value, design, or aesthetics.\n",
        "   - Often about:\n",
        "     - reaction (how appealing or impactful something is: “boring”, “exciting”, “moving”),\n",
        "     - composition (harmony, complexity, balance: “well-structured”, “chaotic”),\n",
        "     - valuation (worth, significance: “important”, “valuable”, “pointless”).\n",
        "   - Typical linguistic cues:\n",
        "     - evaluations of things or outcomes (“beautiful view”, “poor performance”, “excellent report”).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Ambiguous\n",
        "   - Use “ambiguous” when:\n",
        "     - more than one type (Affect, Judgment, Appreciation) clearly applies,\n",
        "       AND none of them is clearly dominant, OR\n",
        "     - the available text is too short or vague to reliably decide which type it is.\n",
        "   - In such cases, mark the types you are considering with 1 (e.g. Affect = 1, Judgment = 1)\n",
        "     and set \"label\" to \"ambiguous\".\n",
