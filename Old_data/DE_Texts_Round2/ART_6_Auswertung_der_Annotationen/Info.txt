The table contains two things:

  - Rows/ Sentences where annotators agree in ALL specified columns_to_check
    - Rows/ Sentences where annotators disagree in ANY of those columns
    
    
    Using this, you can check where the disagreement was. 
    Maybe there is a pattern throughout all disciplines that shows us what annotators disagreed on.
    
    
    
Preprocessing:
We had to delete line  88 (ofc in both datasets because there was a mistake in one of annotations)
