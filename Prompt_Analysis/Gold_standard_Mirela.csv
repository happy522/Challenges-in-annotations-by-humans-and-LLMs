Phi8.,S104,You might say that we become the authors of our own lives.,1,,1,
Phi8.,S109,"You might decide to be a pink sock-wearing, cereal-loving, country-living banker, and I might decide to be a black sock-wearing, urban, donut-loving artist.",1,,1,
Phi8.,S15,You could have high fiber bran cereal or a chocolate donut.,0,,,
Phi8.,S12,"You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country, because staying is better in some ways, moving is better in others, and neither is better than the other overall.",1,1,,1
Phi8.,S108,Who am I to be?,0,,,
Phi8.,S91,"When you think about it,",0,,,
Phi8.,S103,"When we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that, we wholeheartedly become the people that we are.",1,,1,
Phi8.,S96,"When we choose between options that are on a par, we can do something really rather remarkable.",1,,1,
Phi8.,S21,"When I graduated from college, I couldn't decide between two careers, philosophy and law.",0,,,
Phi8.,S94,"When alternatives are on a par, the reasons given to us, the ones that determine whether we're making a mistake, are silent as to what to do.",0,,,
Phi8.,S82,"When alternatives are on a par, it may matter very much which you choose, but one alternative isn't better than the other.",1,,,1
Phi8.,S110,What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us.,1,,1,
Phi8.,S9,What makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate.,1,,,1
Phi8.,S58,We've got two jobs.,0,,,
Phi8.,S65,"We're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all, not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs.",1,,1,
Phi8.,S25,"Well, that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity.",1,1,,
Phi8.,S68,"We unwittingly assume that values like justice, beauty, kindness, are akin to scientific quantities, like length, mass and weight.",1,,1,
Phi8.,S13,We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big.,1,,1,
Phi8.,S78,"We shouldn't assume that the world of is, of lengths and weights, has the same structure as the world of ought, of what we should do.",1,,1,
Phi8.,S80,"We need to introduce a new, fourth relation beyond being better, worse or equal, that describes what's going on in hard choices.",1,1,,
Pol2.,S81,"You can run for the Senate out of a different state, but it's hard to do that as a mayor.",1,,1,
Pol2.,S116,"Yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders, a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders, maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières, of economics and technology without borders, of education without borders, of terrorism and war without borders.",1,,,1
Pol2.,S49,Why?,0,,,
Pol2.,S90,"When states face each other, China and the U.S., they face each other like this.",0,,,
Pol2.,S32,"When I say if mayors ruled the world, when I first came up with that phrase, it occurred to me that actually, they already do.",0,,,
Pol2.,S91,"When cities interact, they interact like this.",0,,,
Pol2.,S42,"Well, to understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.",1,1,1,
Pol2.,S54,"We saw this a couple of decades ago when Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem in the '80s and the '90s, was besieged one day in his office by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds, Christian prelates, rabbis, imams.",1,,1,
Pol2.,S21,"We pay taxes, we vote occasionally, we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us.",1,,1,
Pol2.,S93,We heard more about who will be number one.,0,,,
Pol2.,S125,"We can create not a League of Nations, which failed, but a League of Cities, not a United or a dis-United Nations, but United Cities of the World.",1,,1,
Pol2.,S126,We can create a global parliament of mayors.,0,,,
Pol2.,S10,"We are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy, and at the same time protest those who would take our freedom, take place.",0,,,
Pol2.,S9,We are talking about the cradle of democracy.,0,,,
Pol2.,S30,"We are an urban species, at home in our cities.",1,,1,
Pol2.,S52,"Washington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals, are anything but pragmatic, but real city mayors have to be pragmatists.",1,,1,
Pol2.,S20,"Very different than nation-states, which are abstractions.",1,,,1
Pol2.,S35,"UCLG, United Cities and Local Governments; ICLEI, the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.",0,,,
Pol2.,S4,"Twenty-first-century, transnational world of problems and challenges, 17th-century world of political institutions.",1,,,1
Pol2.,S43,"To be a prime minister or a president, you have to have an ideology, you have to have a meta-narrative, you have to have a theory of how things work, you have to belong to a party.",1,,1,
Pol9.,S101,Your head gets bigger.,1,,1,
Pol9.,S104,"You know, he never quite made it to all of them every day, but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners.",1,,1,
Pol9.,S15,"Women would say, ""Well I've been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him.""",0,,,
Pol9.,S55,"What's going on?""",0,,,
Pol9.,S2,"What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia, but of the 113 developing countries that torture, 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured.",0,,,
Pol9.,S42,"What can we do?""",0,,,
Pol9.,S94,"Well, I would say this.",0,,,
Pol9.,S4,"We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst, but, in fact, 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners.",1,,1,
Pol9.,S84,We need to systematically implement early access to counsel.,1,1,,
Pol9.,S71,"We have a program called JusticeMakers, and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things, but how can we support them?",1,,1,
Pol9.,S97,Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province.,0,,,
Pol9.,S78,"This is fantastic.""",1,,,1
Pol9.,S53,"They were torturing everybody all the time.""",1,,1,
Pol9.,S8,The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel.,1,,,1
Pol9.,S52,The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution.,1,,1,
Pol9.,S50,"The key that we see, though, is training and then early access.",1,,,1
Pol9.,S69,The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment.,1,,1,
Pol9.,S17,"The first group of defenders came together and I still remember, as I was training, I said, ""Okay, what do you do for an investigation?""",0,,,
Pol9.,S99,"So, you know, there's bars.",0,,,
Pol9.,S65,"So the pieces are, not only the training of the lawyers, but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel, because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured.",1,,,1
Psy5.,S67,You know what else feels less awkward over email and text?,1,1,,
Psy5.,S83,"You go online, you can choose the individual teacher by name whose classroom you're going to be able to help by literally buying the specific items they've requested, like microscopes or laptops or flexible seating.",1,,1,
Psy5.,S57,"When you have a relationship with someone, helping one another is actually a natural part of that relationship.",1,,,1
Psy5.,S5,"When I was a kid, we took a family vacation.",0,,,
Psy5.,S76,"What is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed, that it had impact, that you were effective.",1,,1,1
Psy5.,S31,We really can't blame other people for not just spontaneously offering to help us when we don't actually know that that's what is wanted.,1,,1,
Psy5.,S6,We drove from our home in South Jersey to Colonial Williamsburg.,0,,,
Psy5.,S39,"We don't actually know what it is you want from us, and, just as important, we don't know whether or not we can be successful in giving you the help.",1,,1,
Psy5.,S96,We are all a little bit afraid to do it.,1,1,,
Psy5.,S14,"We all, to some extent, suffer from something that psychologists call ""the illusion of transparency"" -- basically, the mistaken belief that our thoughts and our feelings and our needs are really obvious to other people.",1,1,,
Psy5.,S38,"Vague, sort of indirect requests for help actually aren't very helpful to the helper, right?",1,,,1
Psy5.,S50,"This is really important: please avoid disclaimers, apologies and bribes.",1,,,1
Psy5.,S75,This is not true.,1,,,1
Psy5.,S15,"This is not true, but we believe it.",1,,1,1
Psy5.,S17,"This is a really, really bad assumption.",1,,,1
Psy5.,S78,"This happened; I was a university professor for many years, I wrote lots and lots of letters of recommendation for people to get jobs or to go into graduate school.",0,,,
Psy5.,S89,They get to know that they made a difference.,1,,1,
Psy5.,S88,They get pictures.,0,,,
Psy5.,S25,"They get nasty real quick, don't they?",1,,1,
Psy5.,S86,They follow up.,0,,,
Psy8.,S35,You've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present.,0,,,
Psy8.,S70,You'd never want to play.,1,1,,
Psy8.,S16,"Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less, or to graduate from college instead of dropping out, but the differences in happiness tend to be small.",1,,,1
Psy8.,S17,"Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?",1,,,1
Psy8.,S28,"What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating, and that's mind-wandering.",1,1,,
Psy8.,S51,"What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV?",0,,,
Psy8.,S25,"We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before, over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people.",1,1,,1
Psy8.,S6,We're richer.,1,,1,
Psy8.,S78,"We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person, and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight into the causal direction.",1,,1,
Psy8.,S45,"Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness.",1,1,,
Psy8.,S75,"Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not backward.",1,,,1
Psy8.,S83,"Well, how often do people's minds wander?",0,,,
Psy8.,S12,"Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.",1,,,1
Psy8.,S7,We live longer.,0,,,
Psy8.,S8,We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.,0,,,
Psy8.,S41,"We can't change the physical reality in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.",1,,,1
Psy8.,S84,"Turns out, they wander a lot.",0,,,
Psy8.,S88,"This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth, to 50 percent when they're working, to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at.",1,,1,
Psy8.,S30,"This guy is sitting here working on his computer, and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month, wondering what he's going to have for dinner.",0,,,
Psy8.,S57,"This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis, and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present, when they're not mind-wandering.",0,,,
Sci7.,S18,"You know, this question has been around for thousands of years, since at least the time of the Greek philosophers.",0,,,
Sci7.,S11,Why does our universe exist?,0,,,
Sci7.,S94,"Why are you bothering?""",1,,1,
Sci7.,S10,Why are we here?,0,,,
Sci7.,S17,Who is out there?,0,,,
Sci7.,S82,"We're not ready, we don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets.",1,,1,
Sci7.,S97,"Well, you know, our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere to 20 percent by volume.",0,,,
Sci7.,S75,"Well, we don't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres, although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that.",1,1,1,
Sci7.,S27,"Well, the biologists get furious with me for saying that, because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet.",1,1,1,
Sci7.,S73,"Well, science fiction got some things wrong.",1,,,1
Sci7.,S143,"Well, in the best case, we will find an image of another exo-Earth.",1,,1,
Sci7.,S28,"Well, if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside and zoom in to where our sun is, we see a real map of the stars.",1,,,1
Sci7.,S108,"Well, I had my own crazy theory.",1,,,1
Sci7.,S110,"Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said, ""Sure, come and talk to me.""",0,,,
Sci7.,S93,We'll never be able to study them.,1,,1,
Sci7.,S62,We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes.,0,,,
Sci7.,S8,"We know, statistically speaking, that every star has at least one planet.",0,,,
Sci7.,S41,"We know their size, and their orbit and things like that.",0,,,
Sci7.,S54,"We know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars, and there's likely many more out there.",1,,,1
Sci7.,S72,We have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases on other planets.,1,,1,
Sci10.,S129,"Your upbringing, your political perspective, your faith -- what shapes your own biases?",0,,,
Sci10.,S56,"Your mood today doesn't necessarily tell me anything about your personality, nor does a cold day tell me anything about climate change, or a hot day, for that matter.",1,,,1
Sci10.,S125,You take inventory of your own biases.,0,,,
Sci10.,S85,You see Hurricane Harvey there?,0,,,
Sci10.,S19,"You never hear that, because gravity is a thing.",1,,,1
Sci10.,S18,"You never hear anyone say, ""Do you believe, if you go to the top of that building and throw a ball off, it's going to fall?""",0,,,
Sci10.,S72,"You just tend to remember the occasional miss, you do.",0,,,
Sci10.,S128,Where do they come from?,0,,,
Sci10.,S117,"When in fact, the perception was that it was not going to be as bad, but it was actually an upgrade.",1,,,1
Sci10.,S113,Whatever you want to call it.,0,,,
Sci10.,S131,"What do you read, what do you listen to, to consume your information on science?",0,,,
Sci10.,S29,"Well, I'll come a little bit closer to home for me, climate change.",0,,,
Sci10.,S22,"Well, consider these facts.",0,,,
Sci10.,S109,"Well we don't even have to go to Houston, we can come very close to home.",0,,,
Sci10.,S55,"Weather is your mood, climate is your personality.",0,,,
Sci10.,S64,"We just recently had Groundhog Day, right?",0,,,
Sci10.,S122,"We increase the radius, we increase the area.",0,,,
Sci10.,S93,We have knowledge.,1,,,1
Sci10.,S68,"We grew up on the Farmer's Almanac, people are familiar with it.",0,,,
Sci10.,S58,Two scholars from Cornell came up with the Dunning-Kruger effect.,0,,,
Tech10.,S25,"You can see it has to be really, really wide in order to have a high enough surface area to process all of the air required, because remember, we're trying to capture just 400 molecules out of a million.",1,,,1
Tech10.,S118,"Yet when I talk to them about my work on carbon capture, I find that they're equally amazed, and that's because combatting climate change by capturing carbon isn't just about saving a polar bear or a glacier.",1,1,,
Tech10.,S2,What does this even mean?,0,,,
Tech10.,S85,"We really need regulation, we need subsidies, taxes on carbon.",1,1,,
Tech10.,S84,"We could have all of the clever thinking and technology in the world, but it's not going to be enough in order for this technology to have a significant impact on climate.",1,,1,1
Tech10.,S26,"Using the liquid-based approach to do this, you take this high surface area packing material, you fill the contactor with the packing material, you use pumps to distribute liquid across the packing material, and you can use fans, as you can see in the front, to bubble the air through the liquid.",0,,,
Tech10.,S99,"Turns out, it's actually significant.",1,,,1
Tech10.,S68,This next image that I'm showing you is a map of the Amazon rainforest.,0,,,
Tech10.,S70,This is the equivalent of roughly 25 percent of our annual emissions in the US.,0,,,
Tech10.,S24,This is called an air contactor.,0,,,
Tech10.,S113,"This approach is so alluring that it can even be risky, as some may cling onto it as some kind of total solution to our climate crisis.",1,,,1
Tech10.,S57,They're based out of Canada.,0,,,
Tech10.,S62,They use solid materials for capture.,0,,,
Tech10.,S58,"They use a liquid-based approach for separation combined with burning super-abundant, cheap natural gas to supply the heat required.",0,,,
Tech10.,S59,They have a clever approach that allows them to co-capture the CO2 from the air and the CO2 that they generate from burning the natural gas.,1,,,1
Tech10.,S65,"They focus on the heat required and the speed in which it moves through the material so that they're able to release and produce that CO2 at a really fast rate, which allows them to have a more compact design and overall cheaper costs.",1,,,1
Tech10.,S80,"These are not large enough to solve our climate crisis, and so what we need to do is we need to actually think about what it could take.",1,1,,1
Tech10.,S53,"There's a company today, a commercial-scale company, that can do this as low as 600 dollars a ton.",1,,1,
Tech10.,S19,There are two basic approaches to growing or building such a forest.,1,,,1
Tech10.,S54,There are several other companies that are developing technologies that can do this even cheaper than that.,1,,1,
Tech21.,S99,You see the local laborers.,0,,,
Tech21.,S100,You see the English engineer giving directions in the background.,0,,,

Tech21.,S3,You can walk around them.,0,,,

Tech21.,S32,Who would I meet?,0,,,
Tech21.,S29,Where would it go?,0,,,
Tech21.,S75,"We've only communicated via this telepresence system, which always makes me think of him as the man inside the Internet.",0,,,
Tech21.,S16,We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.,1,,1,
Tech21.,S106,We let other people worry about it.,1,1,,
Tech21.,S14,We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.,1,,1,
Tech21.,S105,We are less connected to it.,1,1,1,
Tech21.,S30,Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?,0,,,
Tech21.,S68,"Three years ago, when I started thinking about this, there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa, represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.",0,,,
Tech21.,S66,"This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.",0,,,
Tech21.,S59,"They're three or five or eight thousand miles in length, and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process is shockingly simple.",1,,,1
