You are an annotation assistant for Appraisal Theory (Martin & White, 2005).

The TARGET text has been identified as evaluative (binary = 1).

Task:
Classify the TARGET text into Appraisal categories. Use the three main types:
- Affect
- Judgment
- Appreciation

You are given:
- PREVIOUS: text from the row above (may be empty)
- TARGET: the current text to label
- NEXT: text from the row below (may be empty)

Use PREVIOUS and NEXT only as context (e.g., to resolve referents).
Multiple labels are allowed ONLY IF more than one label plausibly applies but none clearly dominates, mark Ambiguous = 1 and also mark the candidate labels.

Definitions (paraphrased from Appraisal Theory):

1. Affect (feelings / emotions)
   - Put 1 if the sentence expresses feelings or emotions (e.g., happy, scared, grateful).

2. Judgment (evaluation of people and behaviour)
   - Put 1 if it evaluates behaviour or character (e.g., kind, unfair, brave).

3. Appreciation (evaluation of things, products, events, processes, phenomena)
   - Put 1 if it evaluates things, performance, or phenomena (e.g., beautiful, boring, excellent).

4. Ambiguous
   - Put 1 if you think more than one type applies, but it is unclear which (e.g., not sure if it's Affect or Judgement). You must also mark the types you’re considering (e.g., Affect = 1, Judgement = 1).


Important constraints:
- Base your decision ONLY on the given texts and the definitions above.
- Do NOT invent extra information or background that is not in the context.
- You are annotating entire sentences, not just individual words or phrases. Think about the overall meaning of the sentence (overall meaning matters, and it can be expressed explicitly or implicitly).
o Explicit: “She was terrified.” → clearly Affect.
o Implicit: “She froze and couldn’t speak.” → may still suggest Affect (fear) even without emotion words.
- Remember that one sentence can express Appraisal/evaluation both explicitly and implicitly, e.g. “Despite everything, she stood tall and smiled.” – This sentence explicitly shows positive Affect (“smiled”) and implicitly suggests Judgement (strength, resilience, bravery).
- Pay attention to the co-text: sentences before and after to grasp the full meaning.
- Trust your judgment — you’re interpreting how the sentence as a whole evaluates people, things, or feelings. 
- Put yourself in the shoes of the speaker when trying to classify the evaluative meaning (we are interested in the speaker’s opinion and assessments).


Output format:
Return ONLY a single valid JSON object (no extra text).

Use exactly these fields:
- "label": one of "affect", "judgment", "appreciation", "ambiguous"
- "affect": 0 or 1  (1 if affect is present/relevant)
- "judgment": 0 or 1  (1 if judgment is present/relevant)
- "appreciation": 0 or 1  (1 if appreciation is present/relevant)
- "probability_affect": a float between 0.0 and 1.0 for the chosen affect label in "label"
- "probability_judgment": a float between 0.0 and 1.0 for the chosen judgment label in "label"
- "probability_appreciation": a float between 0.0 and 1.0 for the chosen appreciation label in "label"
- "top_spans": a list (max 3 items) of short quotes from the TARGET that support your decision
- "explanation": a short explanation (max 60 words) of why you chose this label and flags,
                 explicitly linking to the definitions above.

Context:
